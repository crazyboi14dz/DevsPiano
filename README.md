@everyone Your SECOND Hackathon is finally here! ðŸŽ‰

I have an amazing project for you guys to make. And in comparison to your first hackathon because of which I will be expecting a lot of innovation.

Topic: *Creating the game PIANO TILES aka Don't Tap The White Tiles*

Ref : http://tanksw.com/piano-tiles/

Features: 
Okay, so getting this part straight is the most important. Have you ever played this game? It was a block buster around a decade back. It is available on android and iphone. Would suggest you to spend some time. It is quite simple though.

1. Bare minimum what the hackathon wants is to replicate the arcade mode of this game
2. It has to be playable with mouse clicks as well as with keys A,S,D,F.

Criteria of judgement:
*The final app will be tested by us on mobile. So that is where it should work the best!*
-Complete the bare minimum but we encourage innovating more into it if time permits
-Make sure your game is tuned to give the user a slight challenge just like the real game.

How to participate in the hackathon:
There is no form to fill out. Just make/join a team in <#1023126326531596288>  if you haven't already and get to work with teammates in VCs.
- a hackathon team can be of size 1-4. teammates do not have to be of the same team that they are in the bootcamp.

*No guardrails this time. Anything and can be used. The agenda is to learn new stuff here so just make sure you don't copy things directly.*

Timeline:
- starts right now
- ends at 3rd October 6pm IST. An announcement with a form link will be made at that point to submit your entry (link to deployed project. you can use heroku / netlify / GitHub pages for this)
- result will come by next week

Hope that clarifies everything. tag me <@423498663583547394>   in <#1023126326531596288> for any concerns. Get set go.ðŸš€

Time to go wild.
All the best.
Godspeed ðŸ’¯
